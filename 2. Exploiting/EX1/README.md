# EX 1 - Understanding the stack

In this program we'll exploit our first binary overflowing a buffer with a greater length than allowed.

## Requirements

- GCC installed
- A 32bits debian VM (I use a osboxes vdi of debian server: https://www.osboxes.org/debian/) with GDB installed

## Needed mitigations knowledge 

How BOF vulnerabilities have a long history, currently there are many mitigations to protect binaries from this attacks, some may be:

- *ASLR*:	Address Space Layout Randomization or ASLR is a technology that randomizes the memory addresses making hard to attackers to calculate stack addresses and leak values or write [shellcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellcode). More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization 
To manage ASLR you can execute in the linux terminal:

						To disable:
							sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0

						Or:
							echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
														

						To enable:
							sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2

						Or:
							echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

- *PIE*: Pie function changes randomly the memory address before each execution, such as ASLR but internally in the binary.

					To disable we need the flag `-no-pie`:
						gcc -no-pie victim.c -o victim



## Step 1 - Compilation & code analysis

Once we have disabled the ASLR, we'll compile the binary with the flag `-no-pie`:

						gcc -no-pie victim.c -o victim

and execute this:
